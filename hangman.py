def start_new_game(word, max_tries):
    """
    # Arguments
    Takes a word (string) that the user has to guess,
    and max_tries (int) - the number of tries user has
    before he loses the game.


    # Description
    Before prompting the user always show the letters he still hasn't tried to guess.
    This function should prompt user for a letter, and
    check, whether the letter guessed is in the word.
    If user guessed correctly, reveal the letter to him.
    If user guessed wrong, decrease the number of tries and show the amount of tries remaining.

    Keep asking user for more letters, until he wins or loses.
    When the game ends, ask user to choose, whether they want
    to play the game again.
    If the user types 'n', return False.
    If the user types 'y', return True.
    User will only input 'n','N','y' or 'Y', so no need to handle other cases

    # Return
    Returns a boolean, stating whether user
    wants to have another game.

    Example:
        input: 'Obi-Wan Kenobi',
        execution: user wins, wants to play again,
                    types 'y' when prompted
        output: True
    Example:
        input: 'GANDALF',
        execution: user wins, doesn't want to play again,
                    types 'n' when prompted
